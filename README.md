# Story2Movie V_0.6.4

## About

This is an iOS client for [Story2Movie Studio LLC](http://new.story2movie.com/), a small wedding photography and videography company owned by my friend. We planned to build a stunning presentation for the photo and video product and use it to attract more future clients. We based this off the the Facebook [Paper](https://www.facebook.com/paper) app and here's a screen cast [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTkS1FNw_qg). The prototype is good but implementation proved to be extremely time-consuming and complicated.

We aborted the plan considering the Return On Investment is too high. But I did have a solid experience on implementing iOS UI, animation and networking.

What I learned from this:

  - Investigate both the feasibility and complexity before starting to code.
